# About this project
Me and my groupmate had 3 weeks to design & code a proof of concept for an idea we'd come up with. Our idea was a platform where you have all the local events in different maps, and the app had to change visually when you changed the map. It had to use modern day web development technologies and it had to be PWA. We chose Svelte because it's really easy & neat to build with. Besides that we used Firebase for a serverless back-end.
